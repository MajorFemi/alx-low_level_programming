This project/task aims at increasing expertise/knowledge in IF, ELSE, WHILE statement in C programming. 
Shall we begin?

Program 0  prints whether the number stored in the variable is positive or negative

Program 1 prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n

Program 2 prints the alphabet in lowercase

Program 3 prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase

Program 4 prints the alphabet in lower case, except letter q and e

Program 5 prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0

Program 6 prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, without usingvariable type "char"

Program 7 prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse

Program 8 prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase 

Program 9 prints all possible combinations of single digit numbers

Program 10 prints all poosible different combination of two digits

Program 11 prints all possible different combination of three digits

Program 12 prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

That's all today's project, hope you find it worthy and relevant.
