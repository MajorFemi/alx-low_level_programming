This contains project on more functions and nested loops. 
shall we begin?

Program 0 (0-isupper) - checks for uppercase character 

Program 1 (1-isdigit) -  checks for a digit (0 through 9)

Program 2 (2-mul) - multiplies two integers

Program 3 (print_numbers) - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9

Program 4 (4-print_most_numbers) - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9

Program 5 (5-more_numbers) - prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14

Program 6 (6-print_line) - draws a straight line in the terminal.

Program 7 - (7-print_diagonal) - draws a diagonal line on the terminal

Program 8 - (8-print_square) - prints a square

Program 9 - (9-Fizz_Buzz) -  prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Program 10 - (10-Triangle) - prints a triangle

Program 11 - (101-prime_factor) - finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143

Program 12 - (101-print_number) - function that prints an integer.

That's all
Enjoy!
