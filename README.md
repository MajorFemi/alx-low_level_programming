This project deals with basics of C programming. Showcasing Preprocessing, Compiling, Interpreting and linking

The Repository 0x03-debugging created aims at improving knowledge in debugging i.e meaning of debuggind, methods of debugging manually, reading error message..

The Repository 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops created aims at diving more into loops and funtions.

The Repository 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings aims at improving knowledge on pointers, arrays and strings.

The Repository 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings aims at giving further clarity and in-depth knowledge on pointers, array and strings.

The Repository 0x07-pointers_array_strings aims to explain further pointers (Double Pointers), Array (2D array, MutiDimensional array) and strings.

The Repository 0x08-recursion aims at showcasing the importance or usefulness of recursion

The Repository 0x0A-argc_argv aims at explaining argument count (argc) and argument vector (argv)

The Directory 0x0C-more_malloc_free dig deep into malloc
The Directory 0x0D-preprocessor aims at explaining everthing about preprocessor, macros etc.
The Directory 0x0E-structures_typedef increase existing knowledge about struct, typedef.

The Directory 0x0F-function_pointers further displays pointer to a function as we've previously learnt about double pointer and pointers

The Directory 0x12-singly-linked_lists is a sub concept under DATA Structure.

0x013-more_singly_linked_lists is to further widen the existing knowledge on linked list
