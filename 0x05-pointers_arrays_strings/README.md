This is for the task/project on pointers, arrays and strings
Shall we begin?

Program 0 (0-rest_to_98) is a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

Program 1 (1-swap) - is a function that swaps the values of two integers.

Program 2 (2-strlen) - is a function that returns the length of a string.

Program 3 (3-puts) - is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

Program 4 (4-print_rev) - is a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.


Program 5 (5-rev_string) - is  a function that reverses a string.

Program 6 (6-puts2) - is a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

Program 7 (7-puts_half) - is a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

Program 8 (8-print_arrays) - is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

Program 9 (9-strcpy) - is a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

Return value: the pointer to dest

Program 10 (100-atoi) - is  a function that convert a string to an integer.

Program 11 (101-keygen) - Creates a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

That's all on today's task!
