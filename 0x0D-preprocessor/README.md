This is all about preprocessor.

The C preprocessor modifies a source code file before handing it over to the compiler. There are essentially three uses of the preprocessor--directives, constants, and macros. Directives are commands that tell the preprocessor to skip part of a file, include another file, or define a constant or macro.

The other major use of the preprocessor is to define macros.
