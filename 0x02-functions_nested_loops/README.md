This project task aims to help understand functions, function prototype, nested loops and header.
Shall we begin?

Program 1 (0-putchar) - prints _putchar

Program 2 (1-alphabet) - prints the alphabet in lowercase

Program 3 (2-print_alphabet) - print 10 times the alphabet in lowercase

Program 4 (_islower) - checks for lowercase character

Program 5 (_isalpha) - checks for alphabetic character

Program 6 (5-sign) -prints the sign of number either +, - or 0

Program 7 (6-abs) - computes the absolute value of an integer

Program 8 (7-print_last_digit) - prints the last digit of a number

Program 9 (8-24_hours) - prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer starting from 00:00 to 23:59

Program 10 (9-times_table) - prints the 9 times table starting with 0

Program 11 (10-add) - adds the integers of two integers and return the result

Program 12 (11-print_to_98) - prints all natural numebr from n to 98

Program 13 (100-times_table) - prints the n times table starting from 0

Program 14 (101-fibonacci) - computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded)

Program 15 (102-fibonacci) - prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2

Program 16 (103-fibonacci) - finds and prints the sum of even-valued terms

Program 17 (104-fibonacci) - prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2

That's all under this task!
Hope you find them useful and relevant!
